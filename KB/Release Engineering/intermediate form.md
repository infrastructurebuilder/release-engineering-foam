# Intermediate Form Releases

Tags: #release-engineering, #dependencies

Intermediate form builds are those that produce an [[artifact]] in some intermediate form, generally out of a [[source code]] repository.  This process is usually the result of a formal [[build]].  If this is the case, every effort should be made to ensure that it remains the case.

Most intermediate forms are best stored in some type of [[artifact repository]].  This allows the intermediate form to be used from a trusted location.

# Why Intermediate Forms?

The intermediate form of an [[artifact]] is one that has had a [[build]] (and possibly a [[release]]) action applied to it.  Therefore, it has gone through all the build [[gatekeeping]] operations and certain criteria can be said about the intermediate form.

These gatekeeping operations are the total of ascribable quality that can be stated about the artifact.  Assuming that they are [[build#Repeatable|repeatable]], they can be thought of as the beginning of an audit trail on the artifact's provenance and quality.

# Examples

Many, possibly even most, languages produce some artifact as an intermediate form.

- Java produces the `.jar` (Java Archive) KJ
- artifact, which is a Zip file with some additional metadata files inside (`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`).  Similar is the `.war` file, which is really just a `.jar` with a `WEB-INF/web.xml` tree inside.
- Similar but somewhat different is a Java EAR (enterprise archive), which often contains [[dependency management|internal dependencies]]
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages
- Platform-specific executables produce by `golang` or `rust`
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/)
- Shared libraries (`.so` and `.o`) files
- `.rpm` and `.deb` packages
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) packages (`.egg`, etc)
- `.zip` files of "stuff" produced from a build

Numerous others also exist.  Most languages use some intermediate form unless they exclusively use [[tag release|tag releases]], which are themselves a somewhat weaker intermediate form.
