# Process Engineering

Process engineering is a component of [[industrial engineering]].  It concerns itself with producing viable and executable processes that allow functions to occur with the least [waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_\(Japanese_term\)) and most output.

For practical purposes, process engineering encompasses most of the elements of industrial engineering. This includes the social aspects, such as ensuring smooth communications and the analysis aspects such as crafting a targeted [[artifact]] based on variant [[environment|environmental]] conditions.

So-called "software engineering" generally _has_ a process, but frequently is designed and performed more organically than intentionally.  This lack of intent makes modern software development look quite a bit more like cooking or farming than like engineering.
