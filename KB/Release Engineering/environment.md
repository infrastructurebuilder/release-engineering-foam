# Environment

<dl>
<dt>environment</dt>
<dd>some very precisely configured platform</dd>
</dl>

An environment is what happens when you make a deployment that generates a specifically configured platform instance.

Environments are instances of platforms that have well-defined criteria associated with them that were specified by the
configuration that was exercised during the deployment that produced them.

For example, "dev" could be considered an environment of the platform that a given application targets.  "Prod" could also be
considered an environment, but perhaps "prod" is different than "dev" for various configuration reasons.
