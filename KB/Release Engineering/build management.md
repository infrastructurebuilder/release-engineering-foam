# Build Management

Build management is the discipline concerned with the [[build|process]] that produces an [[artifact|artifact]] within a software [[release engineering]] system.

# What

At its simplest, a build is a process.  The result of that process, _should it succeed_, is [probably] an [[artifact|artifact]].

The actual representation and content of that artifact are very dependent on the build itself, including the source, language, and mechanisms employed to perform the build.
