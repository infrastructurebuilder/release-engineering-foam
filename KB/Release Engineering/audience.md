# Audience

In the release engineering context, the audience is the expected set of consumers for some [[artifact]], [[platform]], [[environment]], or other consumable.

These consumers can range from a set of human users to other processes that consume artifacts for purposes of greater assembly as part of a [[dependency management]] resolution action.

It should be noted that "audience" is usually synonymous with "customers".
