# Pipelines

The "pipeline" is the set of steps that compose the attributes of the [[build]].  Depending on what tooling is used, this will mean configuration files in repositories or external configuration with additional tooling.

For now, the assumption is that the [[continuous integration|CI]] pipeline has pretty high value; the [[continuous delivery|CD]] pipeline has somewhat lower value; and these should grow as time and effort permits.
