  Packaging
  ===
  
  Packaging is the process of producing a usable [[artifact]].  A package can come in several forms, but the most common is some [[intermediate form]] (like a `jar` or `exe` or a `zip` file) or a [[tag release]]. 
  
  Packaging is the final part of a standard [[build]] process.  For many iterations of the build-test process, packaging is not exercised.  This is especially true for [[tag release]] artifacts.  Also, there is the fact that packaging might also have several other tasks assigned to it, such as building documentation or producing a [[cryptographic signature]].
