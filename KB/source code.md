# Source

Most software comes about by the generation of text files and other assets.  These assets have to be stored somewhere and are collectively known as "source code".

Sources can be stored in any known storage location, such as a filesystem or a database, but the most common location is in a source code repository, such as a [[git]] repository that is hosted on [[git#GitHub|GitHub]] or [[git#BitBucket|BitBucket]].
