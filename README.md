README
======

Some useful links from here are:

- [[Release Engineering Definitions README|Basic Definitions used throughout this vault]]
- [[Formatting]] for the patterns and layouts used in this vault.
- [[Bootstrapping]]
- [[Release Engineering]]
- [[Artifact Management]]
- [Terraform](https://terraform.io)
- [Packer](https://packer.io)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
- [[InfrastructureBuilder]]

You might want to use this as an [[Upstream]] repository for your own vault.

If so, you probably don't want to modify anything in the `KB/` tree.
